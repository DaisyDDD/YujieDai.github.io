About me
======
Hi! I am a PhD student in [Digital Health and Care CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/digital-health/) at the university of Bristol, UK funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). I work as a Data Scientist at the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), UK. My research interests lie in applying machine learning and AI on large-scale health datasets to improve disease diagnosis and treatments.

Under the supervision of [Prof Andrew Dowsey](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-dowsey), [Prof Raúl Santos-Rodríguez](https://www.raulsantosrodriguez.com/), and [Dr Brian Sullivan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ea-0yoMAAAAJ&hl=en), My PhD project, collaborating with the BNSSG Integrated Care Board (ICB) and UHBW NHS Foundation Trust, focuses on infectious disease detection and antibiotic resistance prediction with cutting-edge machine learning and explainable-AI (XAI) based on real-world big data sets, aimed at boosting population health. 

I graduated from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China with a BSc in Software Engineering in 2020 and then worked as a research assistant in the university until 2021. During this time, I have gained knowledge and experience in programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I believe there is huge potential for AI to be applied in the healthcare area, improving life quality for human beings.

In 2022, I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence with Distinction (First Class) at the University of St Andrews, UK. My final dissertation investigated the relationship between the properties of human contact networks and the spread of infectious diseases.

I am always eager to contribute to the advancement of digital health by leveraging AI to solve real-world healthcare challenges and improve patient health outcomes on a global scale.

My name
======
My name in chinese is 雨洁, which consists of two characters 雨 (yǔ) and 洁 (jié).雨(yǔ) means "rain" in Chinese and 洁(jié) means "pure". 
Pronunciation:
* Yǔ (雨) sounds like "yoo" but with a slight "ee" sound at the end.
* Jié (洁) sounds like "jyeh," similar to the "je" in "jet," but with a softer ending.
