I am a PhD candidate in [Digital Health and Care CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/digital-health/) at the university of Bristol, UK, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). I currently work as a Data Scientist at the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), UK, where I contribute to diverse research projects and support researchers with data analysis needs. 

My research interests focus on infectious diseases, particularly Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) and Antibiotic Resistance / Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). My goal is to understand who is affected by these infections, why they occur, and how best to prevent, treat, and monitor them. Additionally, I develop artificial intelligence tools to assist in diagnosing and treating patients in both primary and secondary care settings, with the broader aim of improving population health. I work extensively with de-identified healthcare records and have strong expertise in programming (Python, R, and Java) and medical data analysis.

Under the supervision of [Prof Andrew Dowsey](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-dowsey), [Prof Raúl Santos-Rodríguez](https://www.raulsantosrodriguez.com/), and [Dr Brian Sullivan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ea-0yoMAAAAJ&hl=en), My PhD project, collaborating with the BNSSG Integrated Care Board (ICB) and UHBW NHS Foundation Trust, focuses on infectious disease detection and antibiotic resistance prediction with cutting-edge machine learning and eXplainable-AI (XAI) based on real-world big datasets, aimed at boosting population health. 

I graduated from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China with a BSc in Software Engineering in 2020 and then worked as a research assistant in the university until 2021. During this time, I have gained knowledge and experience in programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I believe there is huge potential for AI to be applied in the healthcare area, improving life quality for human beings.

In 2022, I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence with Distinction (First Class) at the University of St Andrews, UK. My final dissertation investigated the relationship between the properties of human contact networks and the spread of infectious diseases.

I am always eager to contribute to the advancement of digital health by leveraging AI to solve real-world healthcare challenges and improve patient health outcomes on a global scale.

## My Name
My name in chinese is 雨洁, which consists of two characters 雨 (yǔ) and 洁 (jié). <br> 
雨 (yǔ) means "rain" in Chinese and 洁 (jié) means "pure". 

### Pronunciation:
* Yǔ (雨) sounds like "yoo" but with a slight "ee" sound at the end.
* Jié (洁) sounds like "jyeh," similar to the "je" in "jet," but with a softer ending.

A Chinese Poem Related to My Name

**《春夜喜雨》 (Spring Night Delighting in Rain)** <br>
*杜甫 (Du Fu)* <br>
好雨知时节，当春乃发生。<br>
随风潜入夜，润物细无声。<br>

English Translation (by Witter Bynner):  
*"Good rain knows its season;  
When spring arrives, it brings new life.  
With wind, it slips into the night;  
Nourishing all things, soft and silent."*
