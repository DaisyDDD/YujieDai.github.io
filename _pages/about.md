I am a PhD candidate in [Digital Health and Care CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/digital-health/) at the university of Bristol, UK, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). My research lies at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and healthcare, with a focus on developing interpretable AI systems for improving clinical decision-making. 

My doctoral research, supervised by [Prof Andrew Dowsey](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/andrew-dowsey), [Prof Raúl Santos-Rodríguez](https://www.raulsantosrodriguez.com/), and [Dr Brian Sullivan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ea-0yoMAAAAJ&hl=en), is conducted in collaboration with the BNSSG Integrated Care Board (ICB) and UHBW NHS Foundation Trust. It focuses on enhancing the detection and prediction of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and antibiotic resistance using eXplainable AI (XAI) and large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data. By integrating AI transparency with clinical expertise, I aim to develop trustworthy, data-driven tools that inform healthcare delivery and population health strategies.

Previously, I worked as a Research Data Scientist at the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), where I contributed to interdisciplinary projects involving large-scale data analysis, machine learning model development, and data visualization. This experience strengthened my ability to translate complex datasets into actionable insights through robust analytical and computational methods.

My broader research interests include interpretable machine learning, real-world complex data analytics, and data-driven decision support systems across various domains such as healthcare, environmental science, and social data. I am particularly interested in how transparent and responsible AI methods can be applied to extract meaningful insights from large, heterogeneous datasets.

I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence with Distinction from the University of St Andrews, where my dissertation investigated how network structures influence infectious disease spread using computational simulations. In 2020, I had my BSc in Software Engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China where I gained foundational experience in programming, algorithm design, and AI system development.

I am passionate about bridging research and real-world impact by leveraging data-driven methods to tackle complex challenges and advance innovation through AI.

## My Name
My name in chinese is 雨洁, which consists of two characters 雨 (yǔ) and 洁 (jié). <br> 
雨 (yǔ) means "rain" in Chinese and 洁 (jié) means "pure". 

### Pronunciation:
* Yǔ (雨) sounds like "yoo" but with a slight "ee" sound at the end.
* Jié (洁) sounds like "jyeh," similar to the "je" in "jet," but with a softer ending.

A Chinese Poem Related to My Name

**《春夜喜雨》 (Spring Night Delighting in Rain)** <br>
*杜甫 (Du Fu)* <br>
好雨知时节，当春乃发生。<br>
随风潜入夜，润物细无声。<br>

English Translation (by Witter Bynner):  
*"Good rain knows its season;  
When spring arrives, it brings new life.  
With wind, it slips into the night;  
Nourishing all things, soft and silent."*
